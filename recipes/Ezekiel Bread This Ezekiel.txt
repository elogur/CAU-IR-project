Ingredients
4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)

1 cup honey

½ cup olive oil

2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast

2 ½ cups wheat berries

1 ½ cups spelt flour

½ cup barley

½ cup millet

¼ cup dry green lentils

2 tablespoons dry great Northern beans

2 tablespoons dry kidney beans

2 tablespoons dried pinto beans

2 tablespoons salt, or to taste

Directions
Gather the ingredients.

Mix water, honey, olive oil, and yeast in a large bowl. Let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir together wheat berries, spelt flour, barley, millet, lentils, great northern beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans together until well mixed.

Grind in a flour mill.

Add fresh milled flour mixture and salt to yeast mixture; stir until well mixed, about 10 minutes. The dough will be loose.

Pour dough into two greased 9x5-inch loaf pans. Let rise in a warm place until dough has reached the top of the pan, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes.
