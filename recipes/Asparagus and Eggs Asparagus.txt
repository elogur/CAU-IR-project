Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil

1 garlic clove, finely chopped

8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed

2 large eggs

salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions
Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.

Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve immediately.
