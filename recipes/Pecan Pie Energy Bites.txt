Yield: 12 2-inch balls
Ingredients
1 cup pecan halves

⅓ cup rolled oats

1 cup pitted Medjool dates

⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

1 tablespoon maple syrup

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Arrange a single layer of pecans on the prepared baking sheet. Top with rolled oats. Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely.

Pulse pecans, oats, dates, cinnamon, salt, vanilla extract, and maple syrup in a food processor until nuts are ground to desired consistency.

Shape mixture into twelve 2-inch tightly-packed balls. Refrigerate before serving.

Chef's Notes
You can make these "raw" by skipping toasting the pecans and oats.

These will work with any dried fruit and nuts, but for drier, less sticky fruit, you might have to add a little water to get things to hold together.
