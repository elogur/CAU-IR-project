Ingredients
2 cups complete pancake mix

1 1/3 cups water, plus more as needed

3 tablespoons butter, divided

8 slices thick cut bacon, cooked until crisp and sturdy

syrup for dipping (optional)

Directions
Combine pancake mix and water in a medium bowl and stir until just blended (there may be a few lumps). 

Heat half of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until melted.

Dip half of the bacon in the batter until evenly coated and place in the skillet.  Cook undisturbed until lightly browned and slightly puffed, about 2-3 minutes.  Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes or until the pancake is cooked through.

Repeat with remaining bacon and batter.  Serve with syrup if desired for dipping.
