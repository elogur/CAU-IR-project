Ingredients
2 1/3 cups rolled oats

1/2 cup toasted walnuts

2 teaspoons ground Saigon cinnamon

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/3 cup pure maple syrup

1 3/4 cups half-and-half or evaporated milk

1 large egg

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste

2 carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks

1 cup golden raisins

Directions
Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. Set aside.

Stir oats, 1/4 cup walnuts, cinnamon, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk maple syrup, half-and-half, egg, butter, and vanilla bean paste together in another bowl; stir into oat mixture.

Place carrots in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave on High for 45 seconds. Stir carrots and raisins into oat mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining nuts on top.

Bake in the preheated oven until the top is nicely golden and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.

Remove from the oven to cool completely. Cut into squares to serve.

Cook’s Note
If you like a thicker slice, use an 8x8 dish. Baking time will be longer.
