Ham and Gruyère Scones
These ham and Gruyère scones, with tiny pieces of ham and nutty grated Gruyère, are perfect for any time of day. Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, the savory scones are delicious with eggs in the morning, tasty with a bowl of soup or a salad at lunch, and delightful in the evening as a dinner bread.

Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon white sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon salt

3/4 cup butter

3/4 cup cooked ham, cut into 1/4-inch dice

3/4 cup grated Gruyère cheese, grated using large holes on grater

1/2 cup heavy cream, or more as needed

1 large egg, beaten

1 teaspoon water

1 pinch salt

Directions
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Use a pastry cutter to cut butter into flour mixture until it resembles rice or coarse meal. Stir in ham and Gruyère until evenly mixed.

Moisten flour mixture with cream, until dough begins to come together. Add a bit more cream, milk, or water if dough seems dry.

Turn out on a floured work surface and fold dough onto itself. Gently stretch dough, turning and folding 3 or 4 times. Lightly flour a rolling pin and roll dough out 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick, turning dough a quarter turn occasionally.

Cut scones with a lightly floured 3-inch biscuit cutter; press cutter straight down, without twisting. Pat dough scraps together and cut as needed. Line a baking sheet with parchment; place cut scones on the sheet.

Whisk egg, water, and pinch salt together in a small bowl. Brush tops of scones with egg wash, and refrigerate for about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Brush the top of the scones with the egg mixture again.

Bake scones in the center of the preheated oven until tops are crispy and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
