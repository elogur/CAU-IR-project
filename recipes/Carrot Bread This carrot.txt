Carrot Bread
This carrot bread is really a cross between cake and a quick bread. It's bursting with shredded carrots, raisins, maraschino cherries, and nuts. It's delicious warm with butter or cream cheese for brunch. It's really good!

Yield: 1 (9x5-inch) loaf
Ingredients
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour

1 cup white sugar

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon salt

3 large eggs, beaten

½ cup vegetable oil

½ cup milk

2 cups shredded carrots

1 (3.5 ounce) package flaked coconut

½ cup maraschino cherries, chopped

½ cup raisins

½ cup chopped walnuts

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine eggs, oil, and milk in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until well blended. Stir in carrots, coconut, cherries, raisins, and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before removing from the pan to cool completely.

Cook’s Note
I store this loaf in an airtight tin or cover with plastic wrap to keep it moist.
