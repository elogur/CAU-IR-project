Ingredients
30 chocolate creme-filled sandwich cookies, such as OREO®

5 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions
Gather all ingredients.

Add cookies to a food processor and grind into very fine crumbs.

Pour crumbs into a bowl, then pour in melted butter. Mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.

Press mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.

Cook’s Note
If making a cheesecake, there's no need to bake the crust. If pre-baking the crust for another use, such as a cream pie, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C), and bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 15 minutes.
