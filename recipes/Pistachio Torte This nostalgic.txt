Ingredients
cooking spray

1/2 cup salted butter, softened

1 cup all-purpose flour

1/2 cup finely chopped pecans or pistachios

1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, divided

1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 (8 ounce) carton frozen whipped topping, thawed, divided

2 1/2 cups milk

2 (3.4-ounce) packages pistachio instant pudding mix

1/2 cup chopped pistachios

Directions
Gather all ingredients.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

Beat butter with an electric mixer in a bowl until fluffy. Beat in flour, pecans, and 1/4 cup powdered sugar. Spread in an even layer in the prepared dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, about 18 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack, about 45 minutes.

Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer in a bowl until fluffy. Beat in remaining 1 cup powdered sugar and vanilla until combined. Fold in half of the whipped topping.

Spread cream cheese filling evenly over the crust. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.

Whisk together milk and pudding mix in a bowl for 2 minutes.

Pour pistachio pudding evenly over the cream cheese filling. Chill in the refrigerator until set, about 15 minutes.

Spread remaining whipped topping over the pudding layer. Top with pistachios, or top with pistachios just before serving.

Cover and chill in the refrigerator 3 hours or up to 4 days.
