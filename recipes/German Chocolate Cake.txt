Ingredients
1 (13.35 to 15.25-ounce) package (2-layer-size) devils food cake mix

2 1/4 cups shredded sweetened coconut, divided

3/4 cup chopped pecans, toasted

1 (8-ounce) container frozen whipped dessert topping, thawed

Directions
Gather all ingredients. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line baking sheets with parchment paper. 

In a large bowl combine cake mix, 3/4 cup of the coconut, and pecans. Stir in whipped dessert topping until completely combined (dough will be sticky).

Place remaining 1 cup coconut in a small bowl. Coat a 1 1/2 tablespoon size cookie scoop with nonstick cooking spray. Drop scoopfuls of dough into coconut; roll to coat and shape into balls.
Place balls 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.

Bake until edges are just set, 10 to 11 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes. Remove; cool completely on wire racks.
