Whole Orange Blender Cake
This whole orange blender cake is a pretty domed loaf, nicely sweet with big orange flavor, and even a tantalizing hint of delightful bitterness. It's also nice to have only the blender jar to wash when you're done!

Ingredients
1 navel orange or other thin-skinned orange, at room temperature

3 large eggs, at room temperature

1/3 cup butter, melted

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 cups all-purpose flour

2/3 cup white sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/2 teaspoon salt

3/4 cup confectioner's sugar

1 tablespoon orange juice or milk

Directions
 Gather all ingredients. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat an 8x4-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper.

Wash the orange and blot dry with paper towels. Cut in 8ths, removing any seeds.

Combine orange pieces, eggs, sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a blender. Cover and blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover and pulse just until combined and batter is smooth.

Add batter to prepared pan. 

Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Cool in the pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.

Whisk together powdered sugar and orange juice until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled loaf.
