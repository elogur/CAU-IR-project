Ingredients
1 can cherry pie filling

8 ounces cream cheese, softened

1 large egg

1/2 cup white sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 (15.25 ounce) box vanilla cake mix

10 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Pour pie filling into a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Beat cream cheese, egg, sugar and vanilla together in a bowl with an electric mixer until well combined and smooth. Spoon mixture over pie filling.

Spread cake mix in an even layer over cream cheese mixture, taking care not to mix the layers. Pour melted butter over evenly over the top.

Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, 40 to 50 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
