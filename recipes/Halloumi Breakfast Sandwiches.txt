Ingredients
2 large eggs, lightly beaten

2 teaspoons finely minced bell pepper, any color

2 teaspoons finely minced onion

salt and freshly ground black pepper

olive oil cooking spray

2 teaspoons olive oil

2 (2 ounce) breakfast sausage patties (such as Jimmy Dean®)

2 slices halloumi cheese

2 English muffins, toasted

Directions
Add eggs to a small bowl; stir in bell peppers and onion, and season with salt and pepper.

Heat a skillet over medium heat, and spray with olive oil spray. Place two egg rings in the skillet, and pour in the egg mixture, dividing equally between the rings. When eggs are opaque and starting to solidify, about 8 to 10 minutes, release the egg by running a knife around the inside of the ring. Flip the egg and cook about 30 seconds to 1 minute.

While eggs are cooking, heat olive oil in another skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage patties on one side of the skillet, turning once, until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. On the other side of the skillet, cook halloumi slices until they are just starting to turn light golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

To assemble the sandwich, place cheese on the bottom half of an English muffin. Next, layer egg on the cheese and top with a sausage patty. Repeat for the second sandwich.

Season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.

Cook’s Note
I use silicone egg rings, but if you don’t have egg rings, try using a cookie cutter or a canning jar lid flipped upside down.
