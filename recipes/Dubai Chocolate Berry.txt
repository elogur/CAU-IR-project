Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter

1 cup kataifi (shredded phyllo dough), chopped

1 cup pistachio cream or pistachio butter

2 tablespoons tahini

2 cups milk chocolate chips

1 tablespoon coconut oil, plus more if desired

2 quarts strawberries, stemmed and halved

1 cup raspberries

1 cup blueberries

1 cup blackberries

Directions
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add kataifi and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Set aside.

Whisk pistachio cream and tahini together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside.

Add chocolate chips to the bowl of a double boiler set over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Stir in coconut oil and turn off heat; keep warm. 

Arrange the trifle just before serving to ensure the chocolate stays loose. In a trifle bowl or medium serving bowl, add half of melted chocolate. Top with half of strawberries, half of raspberries, half of blueberries, and half of blackberries. 

Top with half of pistachio cream mixture. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup toasted kataifi. Add remaining berries and remaining pistachio cream, and top with remaining chocolate. Sprinkle over remaining kataifi and serve immediately.
