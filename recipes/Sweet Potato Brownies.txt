Sweet Potato Brownies
These sweet potato brownies are light and moist, loaded with chocolate chips, and topped with more chips and pecans. You really won't taste the sweet potato, but it's what gives them their fudgy texture.

Yield: 24 2x2-inch brownies
Ingredients
3/4 cup all-purpose flour

1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

1/8 teaspoon salt

1 cup unsweetened sweet potato puree

3/4 cup packed brown sugar

1/2 cup salted butter, melted

1 large egg

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips, divided

1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions
Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan. 

Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; set aside.

Combine sweet potato puree, brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth.

Add flour mixture  and mix until just moistened. Fold in 1 cup of the chocolate chips.

Pour batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips and pecans, if desired.

Bake until edges and surface of brownies are set but still soft, about 25 minutes. Cool in pan for at least 30 minutes. For best results, chill at least 4 hours before cutting.
