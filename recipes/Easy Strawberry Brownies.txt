Ingredients
1 (15.5 ounce) box strawberry cake mix

1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted

2 large eggs

2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided

3 strawberries, chopped

1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, or more as needed

1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7-inch baking dish.

Mix cake mix, melted butter, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl until well combined. Spread mixture into an even layer in the prepared baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center, 16 to 18 minutes. Allow brownies to cool in the pan for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, puree strawberries and remaining teaspoon of vanilla extract in a food processor or with an immersion blender until smooth.

Stir strawberry mixture into confectionerâ€™s sugar until smooth, adding extra sugar as necessary to reach the consistency of a glaze. Add salt and stir. 

Spread strawberry glaze evenly over the cooled brownies and let stand until completely cooled.  Cut into 12 squares, or refrigerate until ready to serve.
