Ingredients
1 cup dark chocolate chips

20 creme-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as OREO®)

4 tablespoons butter, melted

1 tablespoon instant espresso powder

1 tablespoon hot water

1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder, plus more for sprinkling

1 tablespoon coffee liqueur (such as Kahlua®)

8 ounces cream cheese, softened

1/2 cup white sugar

1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, such as Cool Whip®, thawed

chocolate covered espresso beans, for garnish (optional)

Directions
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until just melted, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring every 15 seconds. Set aside to cool completely to room temperature.

Pulse cookies in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Add melted butter and pulse until just moistened. Divide cookie mixture between 6 martini glasses or small dessert bowls and refrigerate while filling is prepared.

Stir together espresso and hot water in a mixing bowl until espresso is dissolved.  Add in cocoa powder and Kahlua and stir until thickened.  Add cream cheese and sugar and beat on medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Add cooled melted chocolate and mix until just combined.

Fold whipped topping into cream cheese mixture until just combined. Divide mixture among glasses and smooth the top. Cheesecake is best if refrigerated for at least 2 hours.

Serve with a sprinkle of cocoa powder and garnish with an espresso bean, if desired.
