Cherry Torte with Cherry Prosecco Syrup
This cherry torte with cherry Prosecco syrup is my updated version of the humble cake my mother served for many holidays. Her version, delicious with canned tart cherries, may date back to the Depression. I use frozen dark, sweet bing cherries, and a syrup that is so good you will want to pour it on everything.

Ingredients
1 1/2 cups unsweetened cherry juice

1/2 (750 ml) bottle Prosecco

1 1/4 cups white sugar, divided

1 large egg

1 (10 ounce) bag frozen dark sweet bing cherries, thawed, divided

1 cup all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 tablespoon melted butter

Directions
For syrup, pour cherry juice, Prosecco, and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and cook at a lively simmer until syrupy and reduced by at least half, about 40 minutes. Set aside 1 cup cherries for cake; add remaining cherries to syrup; allow to cool. Syrup can be made several days in advance.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a 9x9-inch square baking pan with parchment.

Stir sugar and egg together in a bowl. Stir in the reserved 1 cup cherries. Add flour, baking soda, salt, vanilla, and butter and stir until flour disappears. Spread into the prepared baking pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. The cake will collapse in the center; this is expected. Cool on a wire rack to room temperature.

Cut cake into squares, and spoon a generous amount of syrup with cherries over each serving. Cake and syrup are best served warm or at room temperature.
