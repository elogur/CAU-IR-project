Ingredients
1 1/2 cups water

1 1/4 cups uncooked glutinous sticky white rice, rinsed well

1 (13.5 to 14 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon tapioca starch

2 tablespoons passion fruit puree

1/4 cup pomegranate arils

Directions
Stir together water and rice in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. 

Meanwhile, stir together coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Remove from heat.

Reserve 1/3 cup of coconut milk mixture for sauce; pour remaining mixture over cooked rice, stirring gently to combine. Let cool, covered, 1 hour. 

Meanwhile, for sauce, whisk together reserved coconut milk mixture and tapioca starch in the small saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Cook, stirring constantly, just until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in passion fruit pur√©e.

Stir rice just before serving. Drizzle servings with sauce and sprinkle with pomegranate arils. Rice and sauce can be chilled in separate airtight containers for up to 5 days.
