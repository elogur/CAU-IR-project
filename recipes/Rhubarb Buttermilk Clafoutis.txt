Ingredients
1 pound fresh rhubarb, cut into 1-inch piece

1 teaspoon butter

1/2 cup all-purpose flour

1/8 teaspoon baking powder

1/8 teaspoon salt

3 large eggs

1 cup buttermilk

1/3 cup white sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 teaspoon orange zest

1 tablespoon coarse sugar, such as turbinado

whipped cream, for serving

Directions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread rhubarb in an even layer in prepared pan. 

Roast in the preheated oven until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool 30 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round or oval baking dish with 1 teaspoon butter. Transfer rhubarb to the prepared baking dish.

Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, white sugar, vanilla, and orange zest; add flour mixture and stir until batter is smooth. Carefully pour batter over rhubarb in baking dish.

Bake in the preheated oven until batter is set, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake until top is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes more. Serve with whipped cream.
