Ingredients
2 bananas, peeled and sliced

Directions
Place sliced bananas in an airtight container and freeze until solid, about 1 1/2 hours.

Blend frozen bananas in a blender until whipped and smooth.

Tips
You can whip room-temperature bananas first and then freeze them, but they will have to thaw a bit before you can scoop it (it will freeze completely solid). This can be done, but it doesn't work as well.

You can certainly eat the whipped bananas alone, but I find that it always tastes wonderful to add some peanut butter or chocolate to the blender before whipping to give the "ice cream" some depth of flavor. Be creative and choose whatever you like!
