Fluffy Cake Donuts
This cake donut recipe is very quick and easy to make. They bake up light and crispy with tender cake-like texture inside. I top them with a sweet sugar glaze or chocolate icing, but my husband just likes them plain.

Yield: 12 donuts
Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour

¾ cup white sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon salt

¾ cup milk

2 large eggs, beaten

1 tablespoon butter or shortening

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 cup confectioners' sugar

2 tablespoons hot water

½ teaspoon almond extract

Directions
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a donut pan.

Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla. Beat until well blended. Fill each prepared donut cup approximately 3/4 full.

Bake in the preheated oven until donuts spring back when touched, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before removing from the pan.

While the donuts are cooling, make the glaze: Blend confectioners' sugar, hot water, and almond extract together in a small bowl. Dip doughnuts in the glaze when serving.

Cook’s Note
For a chocolate glaze, stir 1/2 cup melted chocolate chips into the glaze mixture.

You can roll doughnuts in cinnamon and white sugar, if you prefer.
