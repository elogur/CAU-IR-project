Ingredients
2 cups complete pancake mix

1 1/3 cups water, plus more as needed

3 tablespoons butter, divided

8 pre-cooked sausage patties

syrup for dipping

Directions
Combine pancake mix and water in a bowl and stir until just blended (there may be a few lumps).  

Heat half of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until melted.  

Dip half of the sausage patties in the batter until evenly coated and place in the skillet.  Cook undisturbed until lightly browned and slightly puffed, 2 to 3 minutes.  Flip and cook until the pancake is cooked through, 2 to 3 more minutes.
Repeat with remaining batter and sausage. Serve with syrup if desired for dipping.
