Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins
These moist banana chocolate chip muffins are easy to make whenever you have some ripe bananas. They're my kids' favorite homemade treat — they love to see who gets the most chocolate chips in a muffin!

Yield: 12 muffins
Ingredients
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour

¾ cup sugar

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon salt

½ cup vegetable oil

½ cup plain yogurt

1 large egg

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 cup mashed ripe bananas

¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. 

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.

Mix oil, yogurt, egg, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until well combined; stir into flour mixture until smooth. Gently fold in mashed bananas and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.

Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 22 to 25 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Cook’s Note
I like to adapt this muffin recipe for adults by adding chopped nuts or dried apricots.
