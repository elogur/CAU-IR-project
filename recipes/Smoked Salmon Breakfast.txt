Ingredients
6 rye bagels - split, toasted, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces

2 cups shredded Swiss or provolone cheese

1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

8 ounces hot-smoked salmon, skin removed, coarsely flaked

8 large eggs, lightly beaten

2 cups whole milk

1/2 cup sour cream, plus more for serving

1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish

capers and lemon wedges, for serving

Directions
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

Spread half of the toasted bagel pieces in prepared dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups Swiss cheese, the cream cheese, and smoked salmon. Top with remaining bagel pieces.

Whisk together eggs, milk, sour cream, and dill in a bowl. Pour over mixture in baking dish. Press bagel pieces with the back of a spoon to coat in egg mixture.

Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake 5 to 10 minutes more, until set and an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of casserole registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Let stand about 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with additional dill and serve with capers, lemon wedges, and/or additional sour cream.
