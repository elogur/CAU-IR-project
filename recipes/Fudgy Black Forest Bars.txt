Fudgy Black Forest Bars
These fudgy Black Forest bars are a decadent dessert that is somewhere between brownie and cake, loaded with chocolate and bathed in cherries. They're fabulous with coffee.

Ingredients
1 cup salted butter, softened

1 1/2 cups white sugar

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

4 large eggs

2 cups all purpose flour

1/2 cup unsweetened triple chocolate baking cocoa

1 large dark chocolate bar, chopped into chunks (about 1 cup chunks)

1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling

1 tablespoon confectioners sugar (optional)

Directions
Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.

Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating in each egg completely before adding the next.

Stir in flour and cocoa powder until fully combined. Stir in chocolate chunks.

Spread mixture into prepared pan, then pour pie filling over the top, smoothing it out.

Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, then check for doneness. A toothpick inserted near the center should come out with just a few moist crumbs. Bake up to 10 minutes more, if needed.

Cool completely; sprinkle with confectionerâ€™s sugar. Cut into bars.
