Ingredients
French Toast

1 cup whole milk

4 large eggs

2 tablespoons pure maple syrup

2 tablespoons Bourbon whiskey

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

5 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon salt

4 cups dry whole-grain or challah bread cubes (see From the Editor, below)

Toasted Pecan Butter

1/2 cup chopped pecans

1 cup butter, softened

1/4 cup packed light brown sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Streusel

1/4 cup all-purpose flour

1/4 cup packed brown sugar

1/4 cup butter, cubed

1/4 cup chopped pecans

confectioners sugar, for garnish

Directions
Grease 4 (8 to 10 ounce) ramekins. Whisk together milk, eggs, maple syrup, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Add bread. Toss to combine. Divide among prepared ramekins. Chill, covered, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

Meanwhile, make Toasted Pecan Butter: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread pecans on a rimmed baking sheet.

Toast in the preheated oven, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. Watch closely so they donâ€™t burn. Let cool to room temperature.

Pulse butter, brown sugar, and vanilla in a food processor until combined. Add cooled pecans. Pulse until mixture reaches desired consistency. Chill Toasted Pecan Butter in an airtight container up to 1 month.

To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). For streusel, stir together flour and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir in pecans. Sprinkle streusel over bread mixture in ramekins. 

Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and a knife inserted into centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Serve warm with Toasted Pecan Butter and garnish with powdered sugar.

From the Editor:
To make dry bread cubes, preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Cut 8 ounces fresh bread into 3/4-inch cubes. Spread cubes on a 10x15-inch rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring twice, until dry, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool (cubes will continue to crisp). Alternatively, let bread cubes stand, loosely covered, at room temperature until dry, 8 to 12 hours.
