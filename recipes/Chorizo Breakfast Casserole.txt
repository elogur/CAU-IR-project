Ingredients
cooking spray

1 lb fresh Mexican chorizo, casings removed

1 orange bell pepper, finely chopped

1 poblano chile, finely chopped

8 large eggs

2 cups half and half

2 teaspoons garlic salt

1 teaspoon onion powder

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/2 teaspoon chili powder

1 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese

1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese or quesadilla cheese

5 cups refrigerated shredded hash browns

2 avocados, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced

1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions

Directions
Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 13- x 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add chorizo, and cook, stirring to break up meat into small pieces, until browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Do not wipe skillet clean.

Add bell pepper and poblano to drippings in skillet; cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.

Whisk together eggs, half-and-half, garlic salt, onion powder, black pepper, and chili powder in a large bowl until fully combined. Stir in sausage, bell pepper and poblano, and cheeses until well combined.
Spread hashbrowns in an even layer in prepared baking dish. Pour egg mixture over hashbrowns, pressing to fully submerge hash browns.

Bake in preheated oven until eggs are set in center and top is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Top evenly with avocado slices. Sprinkle evenly with scallions.
