Ingredients
1 large watermelon

1 cantaloupe, halved and seeded

1 honeydew melon, halved and seeded

2 (15 ounce) cans mandarin oranges, drained

2 (20 ounce) cans pineapple chunks, drained

2 cups halved fresh strawberries

2 cups seedless grapes

½ cup water

¼ cup white sugar

2 tablespoons grated lemon zest

Directions
With a large, sharp knife, remove the top 1/4 section of the watermelon. With a melon baller, scoop flesh from the inside of watermelon, removing as many seeds as possible. Leave 1/2 inch of flesh inside the shell of watermelon. Scoop cantaloupe and honeydew in the same manner, removing as much flesh as possible and discarding the rinds. Refrigerate watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges, pineapple, strawberries, and grapes separately until ready to assemble.

Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and continue stirring until sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in lemon zest. Set syrup aside to cool.

To serve, place chilled watermelon balls, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges, pineapple, strawberries, and grapes in a large bowl. Pour syrup over and toss thoroughly. Transfer fruit mixture to watermelon bowl. Set aside any fruit mixture that will not fit. There will be enough fruit to refill the bowl.
