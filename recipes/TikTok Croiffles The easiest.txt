Directions
Croiffles with Frozen Croissant Dough
Preheat your waffle iron to medium-low heat, then spritz with cooking spray.

If desired, roll the thawed dough in sugar before cooking (it should stick with ease). Place the thawed dough on the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until golden brown.

Croiffles with Crescent Roll Dough
Preheat your waffle iron to medium-low heat, then spritz with cooking spray.
On a lightly-floured surface, roll out the crescent roll dough with a rolling pin until it reaches an even thinness, being careful not to incorporate too much flour. Cut along the perforated lines. Place 1-2 tablespoons of your desired filling on the wide end of the dough and, starting on the wide end, roll the dough into a croissant shape.

Move the rolled dough to the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook for 1 Â½ to 3 minutes, or until golden brown.

Croiffles with Puff Pastry Dough
Preheat your waffle iron to medium-low heat, then spritz with cooking spray.
On a lightly-floured surface, roll out the sheet of puff pastry dough with a rolling pin until you get a large rectangle with even thinness. Be careful not to incorporate too much flour. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut out 8 long and thin triangles.

Place 1-2 tablespoons of your desired filling on the wide end of the triangle and, starting on the wide end, roll the dough into a croissant shape.

Move the rolled dough to the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook for 4-6 minutes, or until golden brown.
