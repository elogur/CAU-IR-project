Ingredients
2 pink or ruby-red grapefruits

2 navel oranges

4 tangerines

½ cup pomegranate arils

½ cup sour cream

¼ cup frozen lemonade concentrate, undiluted

fresh mint sprigs for garnish (optional)

Directions
Peel grapefruits, oranges, and tangerines with a serrated edge knife, being careful to remove the white pith.

Slice all citrus fruit crossways and remove any seeds. Evenly distribute slices amongst 4 salad plates. Sprinkle pomegranate arils evenly over each salad.

Stir together sour cream and undiluted lemonade concentrate in a small bowl for the dressing until smooth. Drizzle dressing over each salad. Garnish with mint sprigs.

Cook's Note:
Undiluted frozen orange juice concentrate or limeade concentrate may be used instead of lemonade concentrate. Add star fruit for a special touch at holiday time.
