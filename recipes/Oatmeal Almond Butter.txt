2 ½ cups rolled oats

1 cup almond butter

1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

½ cup honey

¼ cup chia seeds

¼ cup ground flax seeds

¼ cup finely shredded unsweetened coconut

Directions
Mix oats, almond butter, chocolate chips, honey, chia seeds, ground flax seeds, and coconut together in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, gradually increasing speed, or by hand in a large bowl, until mixture is well combined and forms a large ball.

Shape into 1-inch balls. Place balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.

Tips
Use maple almond butter if available. You can use either rolled oats or quick-cooking oats.
