Espresso Brownies
Adding espresso powder to these espresso brownies makes them extra rich. I let them sit for a day before cutting into them to let the flavors bloom.

Ingredients
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons espresso powder

1/8 teaspoon baking powder

1/8 teaspoon salt

1 cup white sugar

1/2 cup butter, softened

2 large eggs

2 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate, melted

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 11x7-inch baking pan. Sift flour, espresso powder, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.

Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs until smooth batter forms; beat in chocolate and vanilla extract. Stir flour mixture in just until incorporated; fold in walnuts. Spread batter into prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool completely before cutting.
