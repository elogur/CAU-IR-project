Boursin Scrambled Eggs
These Boursin scrambled eggs, silky smooth with a subtle savory flavor, are what I like to make for breakfast or brunch when we have overnight friends or family visiting. We enjoy them served with sautéed mushrooms and sliced tomatoes on the side.

Ingredients
4 large eggs

3 tablespoons half-and-half

1 pinch salt, plus more to taste

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

2 tablespoons garlic and fine herbs spreadable cheese (such as Boursin®), cold and crumbled

freshly ground black pepper to taste

chopped fresh parsley or chives, for garnish

Directions
Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and a pinch of salt together in a small bowl.

Melt butter in a medium nonstick pan over medium-low heat. When butter starts to bubble, pour in egg mixture. Using a silicone spatula, gently swirl the eggs around in circles from the outside in, without stopping, until you start to see small curds, about 20 to 30 seconds.

Switch from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger curds, about 20 seconds. When eggs are about 75% cooked, gently fold in cheese. The eggs now should be softly set and still a little runny in places.

Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside for about 20 to 35 seconds to allow the residual heat to finish cooking to your preferred consistency.

Garnish with parsley or chives, and serve immediately.

Cook’s Note
Low and slow is the way to go when making scrambled eggs. Be sure to take them off the heat when they are just a bit less done than how you want to eat them. That residual heat will finish them off, so they’ll be perfectly moist and tender, not dry or overdone. Boursin comes in a variety of different flavors, so choose your favorite.
