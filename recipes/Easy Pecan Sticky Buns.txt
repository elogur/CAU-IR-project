Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter

1/2 cup brown sugar

1 cup chopped pecans

2 1/2 tablespoons honey

1 pinch salt

1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste

2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream

1 (12-count)-package Hawaiian rolls



Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 8x8 cake pan with parchment paper.

Combine butter, sugar, salt, and honey in a pan set over medium heat. Stir while cooking until the sugar dissolves and mixture starts to bubble a little bit, 3 to 5 minutes.

Turn off the heat and add vanilla bean paste, heavy cream, and chopped pecans. Mix until the pecans are fully coated and set aside to cool slightly

Pour all of the sauce in the pan into the prepared cake pan and spread it out into an even layer. Add Hawaiian rolls, top side down.

Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is very bubbly and the buns are slightly browned , 15 to 20 minutes.

Let it cool for up to 5 minutes before flipping onto a cutting board or plate

Cookâ€™s Note
A 9x13 pan also works great-- use same amount of sauce for less sauced buns, or you can double the sauce if you want them very saucy.
