Ingredients
1 prepared single crust pie pastry

3 large eggs

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom

3/4 teaspoon salt

1 1/4 cups heavy cream

1/4 cup sour cream

1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste

2/3 cup white sugar

3 tablespoons bourbon whiskey

1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree

whipped cream for serving (optional)

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and set a rack in the center.

Lightly flour a work surface, and roll pastry to a 14-inch round. Press dough evenly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Trim any excess dough and flute the edges. Freeze pie shell for 15 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes before baking,

Poke bottom and sides of pie shell with the tines of a fork; line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. 

Bake crust in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Carefully remove weights and parchment and return the shell to the oven. Continue baking until golden and firm to the touch, about 5 more minutes. Set aside to cool while preparing filling.

Add eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, cardamom, and salt to a large bowl; whisk until well combined. Whisk in whipping cream, sour cream, vanilla bean paste, sugar, bourbon and pumpkin purée until well combined. Pour mixture into pie shell.

Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer the pie to a rack to cool completely.
