Sausage and Cheese Egg Boats
These sausage and cheese egg boats might be the best brunch dish ever. They have the same ingredients as a breakfast casserole, but give me the toasted bread outsides any time!

Ingredients
1 pound breakfast sausage

1 loaf Cuban bread, French loaf, or other “boat-shaped” bread

2 cups shredded Cheddar Jack cheese or Mexican blend cheese, divided

6 large eggs

1/3 cup heavy cream

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/3 cup finely chopped red bell pepper

1/4 cup thinly sliced green onion

Directions
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any excess grease; set aside to cool slightly.

Using a serrated knife, trim off the top layer of bread to expose the inside. Create a well for the fillings by removing most of the bread on the inside. Place 3/4 cup cheese along the bottom of the bread; place bread on the prepared baking sheet.

Whisk eggs, cream, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until well blended. Stir in cooked sausage, bell pepper, green onions, and remaining cheese; pour mixture into prepared bread loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 35 to 40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
