Ingredients
3/4 cup all-purpose flour plus 1 tablespoon for dusting

3/4 cup whole wheat flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/2 teaspoon salt

3/4 cup cottage cheese

3/4 cup honey

6 tablespoons coconut oil, melted, or neutral oil of choice

1 tablespoon lemon zest

3 tablespoons lemon juice

1 tablespoon vanilla extract

2 large eggs, lightly beaten

2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions
Gather all ingredients. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Line pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang. 

Whisk ¾ cup all-purpose flour, ¾ cup whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.

Combine cottage cheese, honey, oil, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla in a blender container. Cover and blend until smooth.

Stir eggs into cottage cheese mixture.

Add cottage cheese mixture to flour mixture; stir to combine. 

Toss blueberries with remaining 1 tablespoon of flour in a bowl. Fold blueberries into batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan. 

Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes.

Remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.
