Lemon Turmeric Crinkles
These lemon turmeric crinkle cookies prove once again that lemon and turmeric are a match made in heaven. The easy lemon-yellow cookie dough is scooped and plopped into confectioner's sugar, then baked until cracked and crinkly into a cake-like cookie that is not overly sweet.

Ingredients
3/4 cup white sugar

2 tablespoons lemon zest (from 2 large lemons)

3 tablespoons olive oil

1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric

4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature

1 large egg

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

3/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

3/4 cup confectioner's sugar

Directions
Combine white sugar and lemon zest in a small bowl, and rub lemon zest into sugar with your fingertips or the back of a spoon until sugar is moist and pale yellow; set aside.

Whisk olive oil and turmeric together in a large bowl; let stand for about 1 minute. Whisk in sugar mixture, cream cheese, egg, and vanilla extract and continue whisking until very smooth and light, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in baking soda and salt.

Add flour; mix with a spatula just until flour disappears. Cover and refrigerate until dough firms up and is no longer sticky, at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment. Place confectioner’s sugar in a shallow bowl.

Scoop dough with a cookie scoop (1 1/2 tablespoon); drop each cookie in confectioner’s sugar and roll gently to coat generously with sugar. Add each cookie ball to the prepared baking sheets, spaced well apart. 

Bake in the preheated oven until very crinkly and slightly golden on the bottom, 13 to 15 minutes. Tops should look fairly dry. Cool completely on the pan before serving.
