Ingredients
2 teaspoons butter

2 slices white bread

2 teaspoons any flavor fruit jelly

1 teaspoon peanut butter

Directions
Gather all ingredients.

Heat a griddle or skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Spread jelly on the unbuttered side of one slice of bread; spread peanut butter on the other unbuttered side.

Place bread slices together, so peanut butter and jelly are in the middle.

Cook on the preheated griddle until golden brown and heated through, about 4 minutes per side.
