Ingredients
1 sleeve graham crackers

5 (1.5 ounce) chocolate candy bars

10 s’more-sized marshmallows

Directions
Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Lay out a total of 10 graham crackers. Do not break apart.

Take 10 s’more size marshmallows and cut them in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Place the sticky side of each marshmallow half onto each square side of a graham cracker rectangle.

Place a piece of parchment into the air fryer basket; place a graham cracker into the basket, marshmallow side facing up. Air fry until marshmallow is toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove carefully.

Gently break marshmallow-topped graham cracker rectangle into 2 squares, add a chocolate bar half on top of 1 square, and sandwich the chocolate with the other square.
