Churros
Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.

Ingredients
1 cup water

2 ½ tablespoons white sugar

½ teaspoon salt

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 cup all-purpose flour

2 quarts oil for frying

½ cup white sugar, or to taste

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions
Gather all ingredients.

Combine water, 2 ½ tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat.

Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.

Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip.

Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer.

Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.

Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.

Editor's Note
We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.
