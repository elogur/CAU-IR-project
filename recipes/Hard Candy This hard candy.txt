Ingredients
cooking spray

3 ¾ cups white sugar

1 ½ cups light corn syrup

1 cup water

1 tablespoon orange, or other flavored extract

½ teaspoon food coloring (Optional)

¼ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions
Grease a cookie sheet with cooking spray.

Stir white sugar, corn syrup, and water together in a medium saucepan. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until sugar dissolves, then bring to a boil.

Without stirring, heat to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.

Remove from the heat and stir in flavored extract and food coloring. Pour onto the prepared cookie sheet. Dust top with confectioners' sugar.

Let cool until hardened, about 15 minutes. Break into about 36 pieces and store in an airtight container.
