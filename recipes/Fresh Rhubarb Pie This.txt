Yield: 1 (9-inch) pie
Ingredients
1 â…“ cups white sugar

6 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed

4 cups freshly chopped rhubarb

1 tablespoon butter

Directions
Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place an oven rack in the lowest position.

Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate with one pie crust. Combine sugar and flour in a small bowl; sprinkle 1/4 of the sugar mixture over the prepared bottom crust.

Heap chopped rhubarb on top and sprinkle with remaining sugar mixture. Dot with butter and cover with top crust.

Bake pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until filling is bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes.

Serve the pie warm or cold. Enjoy!
